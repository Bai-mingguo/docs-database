# Database Security

This document outlines the comprehensive security measures for the AMQ CFD trading platform database.

## Data Encryption

- All sensitive data must be encrypted at rest and in transit.
- Use industry-standard encryption algorithms:
  - AES-256 for data at rest
  - TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- Implement field-level encryption for highly sensitive data such as:
  - Users.password_hash
  - KYC_AML_Data.id_number

## Access Control

- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) using the Roles table.
- Apply the principle of least privilege for database access:
  - Restrict access to sensitive tables (e.g., KYC_AML_Data, UserRiskParameters) to authorized personnel only.
  - Use database views to limit access to specific columns when full table access is not required.
- Regularly audit and review access permissions:
  - Utilize the AuditLogs table to track all access and modifications to sensitive data.

## Authentication

- Enforce strong password policies for all user accounts:
  - Minimum length of 12 characters
  - Require a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
  - Implement password history to prevent reuse of recent passwords
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for database access, especially for admin and privileged users.
- Use secure password hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) for storing user passwords.

## Auditing

- Enable comprehensive database auditing:
  - Utilize the AuditLogs table to record all significant actions, including:
    - User logins and logouts
    - Changes to user roles or permissions
    - Modifications to sensitive data (e.g., KYC information, risk parameters)
    - All financial transactions
- Regularly review audit logs for suspicious activities:
  - Implement automated alerts for unusual patterns or high-risk actions.

## Backup and Recovery

- Implement regular automated backups:
  - Full daily backups
  - Incremental backups every hour
- Encrypt all backup data using AES-256 encryption.
- Store backups in geographically diverse locations.
- Regularly test the backup restoration process to ensure data integrity and system recovery.

## Secure Configuration

- Disable all unnecessary database features and services.
- Regularly update and patch the database management system.
- Use separate database instances for development, testing, and production environments.

## Network Security

- Implement a firewall to restrict database access to authorized IP addresses only.
- Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for remote database access.
- Regularly perform network vulnerability scans and penetration testing.

## Sensitive Data Handling

- Implement data masking for sensitive information in non-production environments.
- Use secure deletion methods when removing sensitive data.
- Implement a data retention policy in compliance with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR).

## Monitoring and Incident Response

- Implement real-time monitoring for:
  - Unusual query patterns
  - Excessive failed login attempts
  - Unexpected spikes in database traffic
- Develop and regularly test an incident response plan for potential security breaches.

## Compliance

- Ensure compliance with relevant financial regulations and data protection laws:
  - GDPR for EU users
  - PCI DSS for handling payment card information
  - Local financial regulations based on operating jurisdictions
- Regularly conduct compliance audits and address any identified issues promptly.

## Third-Party Integrations

- Thoroughly vet any third-party services or APIs that interact with the database.
- Use API keys and OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication with external services.
- Regularly rotate API keys and access tokens.

## Employee Training and Awareness

- Conduct regular security awareness training for all employees with database access.
- Implement and enforce a clear security policy for handling sensitive data.

By implementing these security measures, we aim to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the AMQ CFD trading platform's data. Regular reviews and updates to this security plan are essential to address evolving threats and maintain a robust security posture.
