# Database Testing Strategy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the AMQ CFD trading platform database, ensuring data integrity, performance, and security.

## Unit Testing

- Test individual database functions and stored procedures:
  - Verify correct behavior of triggers and constraints
  - Test edge cases and boundary conditions

- Verify data integrity constraints:
  - Test primary key and unique constraints
  - Validate foreign key relationships
  - Check default values and NOT NULL constraints

- Test data type validations:
  - Ensure proper handling of different data types (e.g., DECIMAL for financial calculations)
  - Verify date and time handling

## Integration Testing

- Test database interactions within the context of the entire application:
  - Verify correct data flow between different modules (e.g., order placement affecting account balance)
  - Test complex transactions involving multiple tables (e.g., executing a trade)

- Test database connection pooling:
  - Verify proper management of database connections under various load conditions

- Validate ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) functionality:
  - Ensure correct mapping between application objects and database tables
  - Test complex queries generated by the ORM

## Performance Testing

- Conduct load testing to simulate high-volume trading scenarios:
  - Test database performance under expected peak loads
  - Identify performance bottlenecks and optimize accordingly

- Measure and optimize query response times:
  - Profile slow queries and optimize them
  - Verify index usage in complex queries

- Test database scalability:
  - Verify performance with increasing data volumes
  - Test read/write performance with multiple concurrent users

- Stress testing:
  - Push the database beyond expected operational capacity
  - Identify breaking points and failure modes

## Security Testing

- Perform penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities:
  - Test for SQL injection vulnerabilities
  - Verify protection against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks

- Test access control mechanisms:
  - Verify role-based access control (RBAC) implementation
  - Ensure proper segregation of duties (e.g., trading vs. compliance roles)

- Verify data encryption implementation:
  - Test encryption of sensitive data at rest (e.g., KYC information)
  - Verify secure transmission of data in transit

- Test authentication mechanisms:
  - Verify secure password hashing
  - Test multi-factor authentication processes

- Audit trail testing:
  - Ensure all required actions are properly logged in the AuditLogs table
  - Verify the integrity and non-repudiation of audit logs

## Data Migration Testing

- Test data migration scripts and procedures:
  - Verify successful migration of data from legacy systems (if applicable)
  - Test data transformation and cleansing processes

- Verify data integrity before and after migration:
  - Ensure all records are correctly transferred
  - Validate data consistency across related tables

## Backup and Recovery Testing

- Regularly test backup and recovery procedures:
  - Verify the integrity of backup data
  - Test the restoration process to ensure data can be fully recovered

- Simulate disaster recovery scenarios:
  - Test failover to backup systems
  - Verify data consistency after recovery

## Compliance Testing

- Test compliance with financial regulations:
  - Verify adherence to know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) requirements
  - Test reporting capabilities for regulatory compliance

- Data privacy testing:
  - Ensure compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR)
  - Test data anonymization and pseudonymization processes

## Functional Testing

- Test all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations:
  - Verify correct handling of user accounts, orders, positions, etc.
  - Test boundary conditions and error handling

- Test financial calculations:
  - Verify accuracy of profit/loss calculations
  - Test margin requirement calculations
  - Validate risk management parameters

- Test real-time data handling:
  - Verify accurate and timely updates of price data
  - Test real-time position and margin updates

## Regression Testing

- Implement automated regression tests:
  - Ensure new changes do not break existing functionality
  - Maintain a comprehensive suite of test cases covering critical functionality

- Perform regression testing after each significant database change or update

## User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

- Involve business stakeholders in testing:
  - Verify that the database meets business requirements
  - Test real-world scenarios and workflows

- Conduct beta testing with a subset of users:
  - Gather feedback on performance and usability
  - Identify any issues not caught in earlier testing phases

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Testing

- Implement automated testing in the CI/CD pipeline:
  - Run unit and integration tests automatically on each commit
  - Perform automated performance tests on staging environments

- Use database schema migration tools:
  - Test schema changes in isolated environments before deployment

## Monitoring and Logging Tests

- Test database monitoring systems:
  - Verify accurate logging of database events and errors
  - Test alerting mechanisms for critical issues

- Performance monitoring tests:
  - Verify accurate tracking of key performance metrics
  - Test threshold-based alerts

By implementing this comprehensive testing strategy, we aim to ensure the reliability, performance, and security of the AMQ CFD trading platform database. Regular execution of these tests, along with continuous refinement of the testing process, will help maintain the integrity and efficiency of the database as the platform evolves.
